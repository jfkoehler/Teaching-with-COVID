# Coronavirus Teaching Materials

Here are some materials we put together in my classes that use the coronavirus as a topic.  The idea is to demonstrate some basic data analysis and modeling together with web design in Python.  I will continue to update this repository as we move into the Spring semester.

- [Developing a Coronavirus Web Application with Python and Flask](flask_app/): Using a basic Flask application and data from the John's Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center we design and implement a basic web application containing a map and table of updated cases of coronavirus around the world.
  - [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUCTTwyv9AdUQPb6ti9FVX9fmH-mXYkAO)
  - [Code](flask_app/)

- [Mathematical Models and the Coronavirus](mathematical_models/): We walk through some basic models of the coronavirus using conceptual idealizations like linear, quadratic, exponential, logistic, and the SIR model. We also explore the idea of developing a model from the data using Least Squares Regression considered classically and as a time series with moving averages, autoregressive models, and ARIMA models.

- [The Discourse of the Coronavirus.](): Using a combination of social media API's, news api's, and some webscraped data we examine the language around the coronavirus with Natural Language Processing and Python.
